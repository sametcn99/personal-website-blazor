This project is a desktop application developed using Electron.js and Node.js.
The application allows users to create and manage widgets on their desktops.
These widgets enable users to quickly and easily access the information or tools

  such as clocks, weather forecasts, notes, calendars, to-do lists, and more.
  Each widget comes with a range of customizable options, allowing users to
  tailor them to their liking. For instance, users can choose different clock
  formats, select specific locations for weather forecasts, customize the
  appearance of notes, and set reminders on calendars. This level of
  customization ensures that users can personalize their desktop experience
  according to their unique requirements.

  application. Whether users are creating new widgets, customizing existing
  ones, or managing their desktop layout, they can do so without encountering
  any unnecessary complexities.

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Leveraging Electron.js technology, the
  application is compatible with multiple operating systems, including Windows,
  macOS, and Linux. This cross-platform compatibility ensures that users can
  enjoy a consistent experience regardless of the operating system they use.
  Whether they are working on a Windows PC, a macOS laptop, or a Linux desktop,
  users can install and use the application without any compatibility issues.
  This versatility makes the application accessible to a wide range of users
  across different platforms, enhancing its usability and appeal.
