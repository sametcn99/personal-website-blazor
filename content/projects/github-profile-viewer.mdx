## Overview

GitHub Profile Viewer is a web platform designed to help you explore and analyze
GitHub profiles in depth. Originally built with Next.js and Radix UI, the
project was later reimagined with Blazor and .NET for improved performance and a
more robust developer experience. The application leverages the GitHub REST API
to provide real-time insights into any public GitHub profile.

## Key Features

- **Immersive Profile Navigation**: Explore repositories, descriptions, language
  usage, and more with a user-friendly interface.
- **Network Mapping**: Visualize a developer’s professional network and discover
  key collaborators.
- **Contribution Analysis**: View detailed contribution statistics and starred
  repositories to assess activity and influence.
- **Gist Explorer**: Browse public Gists to understand unique coding patterns
  and micro-projects.
- **Universal Access**: Instantly analyze any public GitHub profile without
  setup or registration.
- **Recruiter Tools**: Evaluate technical skills, influence, and community
  engagement in one place.
- **GitHub Login & Access Token**: Users can log in with their GitHub account.
  Upon authentication, the app automatically adds the user's access token,
  enabling access to private data (with permission) and higher API rate limits.
