## Why this extension?

In the modern development era, live streaming, screen sharing, and recording are
part of daily routines. However, most existing VS Code extensions that manage
environment variables have a critical flaw: they process `.env` files only
_after_ the file has been opened. This results in a brief millisecond window
where sensitive keys, API tokens, and passwords might be visible on screen
before being hidden or masked. For streamers and security-conscious developers,
this split-second exposure is unacceptable.

**Env Protector** solves this problem essentially by intercepting the file open
request. Instead of reacting to an opened file, it proactively asks you _how_
you want to view the file before it is rendered. This "security-first"
architecture ensures that sensitive data never hits the screen unless you
explicitly authorize it, providing a robust layer of privacy for your
development environment.

## Features

- **File Visibility Control**: The extension allows you to toggle the visibility
  of environment files (e.g., .env) within the VS Code sidebar. It automates the
  management of `files.exclude` in your workspace settings, hiding sensitive
  files from the file explorer view to prevent accidental clicks during screen
  shares.

- **Proactive Interception Prompt**: Unlike other tools, this extension
  intercepts the request to open an enviroment file. It presents a confirmation
  dialog asking how you wish to proceed, ensuring you are always aware before
  sensitive context is loaded into the editor buffer.

- **Secure Masked View**: When you choose to view a file securely, the extension
  renders a virtual document where all values are replaced with asterisks
  (masking). This allows you to verify the presence of keys and structure
  without exposing the actual secrets (values).

- **Safe Variable Management**: Manage your environment variables without ever
  opening the file itself:
  - **Add Variable**: Insert new key-value pairs via the Command Palette.
  - **Edit Variable**: Modify existing values safely through input boxes.
  - **Remove Variable**: Delete keys without exposing the rest of the file
    content.
