# Getting Started with Blazor WebAssembly

Blazor WebAssembly is a powerful framework for building interactive web applications using C# instead of JavaScript. In this guide, we'll explore the fundamentals of Blazor and how to get started with your first application.

## What is Blazor?

Blazor is a free and open-source web framework that enables developers to create web apps using C# and HTML. It's part of the ASP.NET Core ecosystem and allows you to run C# code directly in the browser using WebAssembly.

## Key Features

- **Component-based architecture**: Build reusable UI components
- **Full-stack development with .NET**: Use the same language for client and server
- **Rich ecosystem**: Access to the entire .NET ecosystem and NuGet packages
- **Modern tooling**: Excellent support in Visual Studio and VS Code

## Creating Your First Component

Here's a simple example of a Blazor component:

```csharp
@page "/counter"

<h1>Counter</h1>

<p>Current count: @currentCount</p>

<button class="btn btn-primary" @onclick="IncrementCount">Click me</button>

@code {
    private int currentCount = 0;

    private void IncrementCount()
    {
        currentCount++;
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

Blazor WebAssembly opens up exciting possibilities for .NET developers to build modern web applications. With its component-based architecture and the power of C#, you can create rich, interactive user experiences.
