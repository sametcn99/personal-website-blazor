# Docker Best Practices for Production

Docker has revolutionized how we deploy applications. Here are some best practices to ensure your containerized applications run smoothly in production.

## Use Multi-Stage Builds

Multi-stage builds help reduce image size and improve security:

```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0 AS build
WORKDIR /src
COPY ["MyApp.csproj", "./"]
RUN dotnet restore
COPY . .
RUN dotnet publish -c Release -o /app/publish

# Runtime stage
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:8.0
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app/publish .
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "MyApp.dll"]
```

## Optimize Layer Caching

Order your Dockerfile commands from least to most frequently changing:

```dockerfile
# Dependencies change less frequently
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm install

# Source code changes more frequently
COPY . .
RUN npm run build
```

## Security Considerations

- Run containers as non-root users
- Scan images for vulnerabilities
- Use official base images
- Keep images updated

## Health Checks

Implement health checks to ensure container reliability:

```dockerfile
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost:8080/health || exit 1
```

## Conclusion

Following these Docker best practices will help you build more secure, efficient, and reliable containerized applications ready for production deployment.
